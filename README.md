## Cheryl Qian, Kenny Lin, Taaseen Ali

### Method Selections
Our implementation of Deque<E> includes:
  addFirst() 
  removeFirst() 
  peekFirst()
  addLast()
  removeLast()
  peekLast()
  
  For accessing, returning, and modifying items in the queue.
  
### Architecture
We chose to use a doubly linked node based implementation of Deque, to keep the runtime constant for all methods.

### To-Do
1) Write interface based on the methods we chose
2) Create overarching skeleton
3) Implement all add methods, test with test cases
4) Implement all peek methods, test with test cases
5) Implement all remove methods, test with test cases

### Development Plan
